# Odin-css-webpage

START:

Hello guys, today, after a good week of work, I decided to keep moving forward on my Odin project, and since I just finished the flexbox part, I need to complete the project! This is going to be (at least I hope so) my first "good looking" website. 

I'm going to first create an HTML file, then the CSS file and style my webpage with a lot of flexbox (I guess), which is a topic that I really struggled with. Let's hope I can get this thing done (and I hope I'm going to commit a lot, for a beginner it's difficult to remember doing it ahah). 

RESULT:
I just finished this project, it took me approximately 5 hours (maybe a little bit less). I was pretty satisfied with the result!

HTML: 
I did the HTML pretty straightforward, that took me something like 40 minutes. I was also happy that I remembered  to wrap almost everything on a div container in order to style it better on CSS. I wrapped on divs the main section of the webpage (header, body one-two-three and the footer), in order to use flexbox styling on the body and stack those parts one atop each other. I then wrapped with divs all the important pieces of content on every main section, this means that I wrapped a left and right part on the header and the footer, I wrapped the cards in a big container and I wrapped every card in a single div, I wrapped with divs even the quote and the author.

CSS: 
CSS was not so easy, but I was expecting this. I tried to align everything almost perfectly, calculating pixels with a calculator. I used A TON of flexbox (I was not expecting this much...), but I think the topic is starting to stick on my mind. I was able to understand (finally) the box model, as I used width,height, margin, padding and border in some clever and fine ways. Talking about flexboxes, I was able to wrap the meaningful things on HTML, hence it was pretty easy to decide what elements would have been flex container and what would have been flex items.

At the end of the day, I was also happy for the fact that I commented a lot of line of codes for my future self, I think that this is an important practice I should build along my journey. One BIG PROBLEM that I faced was the fact that I forgot a lot of times to commit often and early...I would write maybe 40 lines of code without a single commit. Remember to do that, when you have basically lived 20 years with the usual save button as your version control system, it's hard to let git properties stick on your mind when you write some code. I'm surely going to start practice on this more!
