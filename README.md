     - Change the flex-direction to column when needed
   - Manage and understand the box model using margin ,padding, border, width and height
   - Remove bullets from lists
   - Round buttons borders
   - Link to an external non standard font style   
2) HTML
   - Assign descriptive classes and ids to elements
   - Wrap main parts of the web page with divs elements in order to\
     apply flex properties on them
