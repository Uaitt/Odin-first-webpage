# Odin-project

Hello guys, today, after a good week of work, I decided to keep moving forward on my Odin project, and since I just finished the flexbox part, I need to complete the project! This is going to be (at least I hope so) my first "good looking" website. 

I'm going to first create an HTML file, then the CSS file and style my webpage with a lot of flexbox (I guess), which is a topic that I really struggled with. Let's hope I can get this thing done (and I hope I'm going to commit a lot, for a beginner it's difficult to remember doing it ahah).
